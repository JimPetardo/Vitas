#################################################  Vitas Code  ####################################################################
														
Vitas (Virtual Terapy Against Stroke)  is an application based on 3 test and 2 games for rehabilitation post-stroke.
You will find all the necessary file in the "asset" folder.
Let see how it is composed:

In "boxandblock" folder you will find all the separete scene of the different game that you compose to make the build.

Every ""namegame"" folder contains the "namegame" file, so, for exemple, if we look inside "bart" folder you will find the directory containing the script, 
the materials, and other file used (for exemple sound).

You will find also some test that should be finished or that we used as test. For exemple we tried to drow and to make a mirror in the "draw" test and "mirror".
We had work a lot on them so we keep it for future work, infact, some test work fine even if we don't use them in the final vitas setting.
There is also some junk file or default exemple so don't worry if you find usless thing.

Leap Montion and Leap Motion + OV cointains all the plugin and some useful script for leap and oculus implementation, some of them are modded for our necessity,
so beware at using them without reading code.

"BackupDatiPazieti" and "Save" folders are necessary for saving files and log so if you delete them remember to change save position on code.

You will find more code details on the "documentazione".pdf file.

If you are interest in the project instead of code you can read the "presentazione".pdf and the article you will find in the same folder.

We hope you wil enjoy vitas project!
